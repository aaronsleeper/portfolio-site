	description:
		'I led UX for a modular mortgage platform designed for a leading online broker, enabling representatives to generate quotes, draft mortgage documents, and support clients through a dedicated portal. A key innovation was a flexible, white-label design system I architected—built on Google Material—with a streamlined theming engine that allowed teams to rapidly create and customize branded client experiences. I drove design strategy, prototyped all major workflows, presented to stakeholders, and contributed to front-end development. The platform balanced regulatory complexity with user-centric clarity, supporting both in-process and post-loan engagement.',
