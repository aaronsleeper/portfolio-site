	description:
		'Brought in to course-correct a failing UX engagement, I led the redesign of a complex scheduling system that replaced Budd Van Lines\' 45-foot physical whiteboard with a scalable, digital coordination platform. Designed for distributed teams of schedulers and drivers, the tool became a centralized source of truth that dramatically improved efficiency and accuracy. I created the design system, led stakeholder workshops, and contributed to front-end development. The transformation was so well received that one user remarked, "If I could marry this thing, I would." The product not only won back client trust but also delivered measurable time savings and operational clarity.',
