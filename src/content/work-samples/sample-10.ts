		'I led UX for the A-G Course Management Portal, a platform supporting California high schools and districts in managing courses that fulfill University of California freshman admission requirements. The system enables institutions to register, submit, and track course approvals, manage accreditation, and oversee user roles. I designed intuitive, workflow-driven experiences to support annual submission cycles, including drafting, revising, and archiving course entries. Through iterative design and front-end development, I helped streamline a complex, high-stakes processâ€”ensuring the platform was accessible, efficient, and responsive to the needs of educators and administrators statewide.',
