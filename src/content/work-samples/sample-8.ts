		'I led UX for the Tools for Teachers platformâ€”a resource hub designed to support educators with instructional materials, formative assessment strategies, and professional learning. Collaborating with stakeholders from Smarter Balanced, I crafted intuitive workflows, developed interactive prototypes, and contributed front-end code to bring designs to life. The platform helps educators across California access high-quality, standards-aligned resources that enhance classroom instruction and student learning.',
