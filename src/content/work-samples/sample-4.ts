		"As UX lead, I helped shape a white-label platform concept for Accenture, developed in collaboration with Nordstrom. The experience allowed customers to virtually explore retail environments in a Google Street View-style interface—bringing the familiarity and discovery of in-store browsing to digital commerce. I crafted the design system, prototyped immersive workflows, and guided stakeholder alignment through visual storytelling. The project culminated in a $25M contract win for Accenture, validating the platform's strategic value and experiential impact.",
