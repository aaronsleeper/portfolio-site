		"I led UX for a unified scheduling platform serving Discovery's global portfolio of channels. Designed to simplify complex, multi-region programming workflows, the system provided a centralized interface for staff to build and manage channel schedules across time zones and teams. I developed the design system, prototyped all core interactions, and aligned stakeholders through iterative feedback cycles. The platform reduced scheduling conflicts by 60%, significantly improving operational efficiency and cross-team coordination.",
