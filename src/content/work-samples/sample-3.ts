		'I led UX for an internal platform designed to accelerate developer productivity and experimentation. The system enabled users to prototype with emerging technologies, capture successful patterns as reusable templates, and manage private data securely through a permissions-based suite. I created the design system from the ground up, developed key workflows and prototypes, and collaborated closely with stakeholders to align the product vision. A key innovation was a privacy-preserving correlation algorithm that linked PII records via hashed data—enabling insights without compromising security.',
