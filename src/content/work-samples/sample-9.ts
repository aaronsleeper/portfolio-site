		"I led UX for California's official platform for helping college students navigate course articulation and credit transfers across public institutions. The platform simplifies complex academic pathways by providing clear, accessible tools for researching and planning credit transfers. I designed intuitive workflows, prototyped key interactions, and supported front-end implementation. My work improved usability for a diverse user base, including first-generation college students and academic advisors, ensuring the experience was both equitable and scalable.",
